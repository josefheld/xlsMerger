# xlsMerger
Merge multiple Excel files

The intent of this script is to merge multiple Excel (.xls) Files into one.
The files that are desired to be merged are supposed to be in the subdirectory "Originale"

TODO: Handle the case that the originals can be either xls or xlsx files
TODO: Offer a GUI that lets the user have more options to merge xls files
